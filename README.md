# Malaria Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

This project aims to detect malaria by analyzing blood smear images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Google Colab.

## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages the power of deep learning to automate the process of malaria detection using microscopic blood smear images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Malaria Cell Images Dataset" publicly available. It consists of two classes: "Parasitized" and "Uninfected". The dataset contains a large number of images for both classes, making it suitable for training a deep learning model.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The code begins by loading the dataset and displaying random images from both classes. This helps in understanding the data and identifying potential challenges.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data augmentation techniques are employed to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability. These include rotation, zooming, shifting, and horizontal flipping. The images are also rescaled to a common size.

3. **Model Development:** A CNN architecture is constructed using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and BatchNormalization. These layers extract features from the images and classify them into the respective classes. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting.

4. **Model Training:** The model is trained using the training data and evaluated on a separate validation set. Early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques are employed to optimize the training process.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize the classification results.

## Results

The trained CNN achieves high accuracy in detecting malaria from blood smear images. The specific results obtained, including accuracy, precision, and recall values, are displayed in the Google Colab output.
